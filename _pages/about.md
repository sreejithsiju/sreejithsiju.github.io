I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Memphis. Prior to this, I held  NBHM- Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) Bangalore, where I was mentored by Prof. Jaydeb Sarkar.

I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Palakkad under the supervision of Dr. C. R. Jayanarayanan. My doctoral research focused on Approximation Problems in the Space of Compact Operators, my thesis can be found here. 

My current research interests lie in Geometry of Banach spaces, M-ideals, function spaces and related areas in functional analysis.
